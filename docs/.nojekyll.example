# This file can be renamed to .nojekyll to bypass Jekyll processing
#
# If you want to deploy static HTML files without Jekyll processing:
# 1. Rename this file to .nojekyll
# 2. Remove or rename _config.yml and Gemfile
# 3. GitHub Pages will serve the HTML files directly
#
# This is useful if you want to use a different static site generator
# or serve plain HTML files without any processing.
